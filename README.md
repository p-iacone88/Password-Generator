# Password Generator

This project is a simple password generator tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create custom passwords based on their chosen character length and selected character types.

## Features

- Generate passwords of variable lengths (between 8 and 128 characters).
- Customize password complexity by including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

The user color theme of the user interface has been updated to mimic elements of the Google Chrome browser's Dark Theme. These changes are marked with comments in the CSS file.
